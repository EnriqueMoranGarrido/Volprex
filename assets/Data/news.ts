    text: "Moderna is seeking emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration for its Covid-19 vaccine for children 6 months through 5 years of age, the company said Thursday. No Covid-19 vaccines have been authorized for children younger than 5 in the US -- about 18 million people -- and a timeline to potential authorization is not yet clear. Moderna officials have said the FDA is expected to move fast, and a Pfizer official suggested its vaccine for younger children could be available in June, if its authorized. ",

    text: `The pink line on Erin Blakeney's first positive Covid-19 test was so light that she almost didn't believe it. But there was no denying the fever and sore throat that developed overnight, just a few days after she and her husband attended a large memorial service in late March. The couple wore KN95 masks, but many others in attendance had not, even as the service stretched past 90 minutes.

    Blakeney, a 43-year-old researcher at the University of Washington's School of Nursing, is a breast cancer survivor. The Seattle resident says she doesn't meet any strict definition of being immunocompromised, which can raise someone's Covid-19 risk. Both Blakeney and her husband are fully vaccinated and boosted. But she didn't want to take chances, because she's taking medications to prevent a cancer recurrence and she lost a family member to Covid-19 in November 2020.`,

    text: `Much has been said about the healing power of nature. Now, some medical professionals in Canada are increasingly prescribing it.

    Doctors are instructing their patients to wander park trails, feel the crunch of leaves beneath their feet and breathe in fresh air. It's part of BC Parks Foundation's growing PaRX program, which intends to improve people's mental and physical health by connecting them with nature.
    Since PaRX launched in November 2020 participating doctors have prescribed countless hours in the sun.
    "We do have a standard recommendation that you spend at least two hours in nature each week and at least 20 minutes each time to maximize those health benefits," PaRx director and family physician Dr. Melissa Lem told CNN. "There's almost no condition that nature isn't good for, from diabetes to high blood pressure. ADHD in children, anxiety and depression."`,
