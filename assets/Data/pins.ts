No Covid-19 vaccines have been authorized for children younger than 5 in the US -- about 18 million people -- and a timeline to potential authorization is not yet clear. Moderna officials have said the FDA is expected to move fast, and a Pfizer official suggested its vaccine for younger children could be available in June, if its authorized. ",
